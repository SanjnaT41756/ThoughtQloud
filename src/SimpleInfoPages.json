Try to be open to the big change this may be and understand that the secrets they kept from you were to protect and help them."

A child revealing themselves to you in this manner can take a lot of courage and up to this point they may have dealt with a lot of self doubt and fear about how you may have handled it however this deceit was deemed necessary by the child simply to protect them from a harder conversation that they may not have felt ready enough to handle. This revelation is actually a good thing and very telling of your child's comfortability with you and can be used as an opportunity for you guys to grow closer than you ever were before."

The key is making sure the child has a strong support system and understands that they are not on this journey alone. A lot of queer children go through the struggles of being queer alone and that is why they are at a higher risk of  are Being queer is a natural variation of human sexuality and gender identity and is a natural part of the diversity of human experiences"
